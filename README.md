Learned about LIBROSA and RESAMPY library which is used for audio and music analysis. Learned about the EDA and how librosa can be used in deep learning models for audio classification.

If you are trying the extracted features part and finding the error: No module name 'resampy' and lazy loader. First try to install the resampy and lazy_loader and import them and restart the kernel. Though if you are still getting the same error which was faced by me too. I simply went to the audio.py file in librosa library and imported the resampy there (import resampy). After this the error was gone and i was able to continue with my furthur learning.
